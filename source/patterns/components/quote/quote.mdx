# Quote

The Quote component provides the ability to present a person's quote or passage. There are two types of quotes content creators can choose from:

## 1. Media Quote
It proves the option to include an optional image which displays to the right of the quote text. By default comes with a UCLA Blue background color which can be changed by users to other custom background colors.

<Story of={QuoteStories.MediaQuote} />

## 2. Quote
Similar to the Media quote but without the image or default background color. However, users can opt to add background color when creating content.
<Story of={QuoteStories.Quote} />

## Quote technical specs

* `modifier` to pass a custom CSS class.
