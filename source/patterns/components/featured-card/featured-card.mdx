# Featured Card

The Featured content component highlights an event or article of choice when combined with other
events or articles in the Content highlight component. The Featured content component displays larger

the text. The Fatured content component is made up of the following
fields/variables:

## Featured Card Article

<Story of={FeaturedCardStories.FeaturedArticle} />

## Featured Card Event
<Story of={FeaturedCardStories.FeaturedEvent} />
