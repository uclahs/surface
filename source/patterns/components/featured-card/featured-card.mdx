# Featured Card

events or articles in the Content highlight component. The Featured content component displays larger

the text. The Fatured content component is made up of the following
fields/variables:

## Featured Card Article

<Story of={FeaturedCardStories.FeaturedArticle} />

## Featured Card Event
<Story of={FeaturedCardStories.FeaturedEvent} />
