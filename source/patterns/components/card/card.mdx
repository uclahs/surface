# Card

The card component is a compact display option for Articles and Events content.
You will find the cards grouped within other components such as Content Highlight
and Related Articles/Events. The Card's max width is about 336px.
The card component is NOT to be used in Events landing pages or search pages.  There
is a specific component for that called **Event card**, which uses different display attributes.

## Card - Events

The Event story for the card has a unique display that differentiates it from the Article card.
The short date format is placed at the top-left corner of the image using the date badge element.
It also includes the organization name and if the event contains multiple instances, the label
**+ more dates** is displayed which links to the full event node.
