# UCLA Health Web Platform

## An enterprise content management system for the Health Sciences at UCLA.

## Development approach

At the core of the platform are the best practices and standards of today's development ecosystem.
The platform makes heavy use of the [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/) methodology however it does not use the naming convention of such methodology. Instead, we have organized our patterns as follows:

### Patterns organization

* **Base**: These are the global pieces used across the project which include things like typography, colors, sizes, borders and more.
* **Elements**: These are the smallest patterns on any project and act as the foundation to larger patterns.
* **Components**: A component is made up from two or more Elements.
* **Collections**: A collection is made up from two or more Components.
* **Layouts**: Can combine two or more Collections and you can think of them as regions of a website.
* **Pages**: Intended to create prototypes of pages such as Medschool's homepage and others.

## Tooling
The tooling for the platform has been carefully vetted and selected so only the absolute necessary is included. These tools include:

* [Vite](https://vite.dev/) (JS Edition)
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) (HTML Edition)
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Twig
* PostCSS
