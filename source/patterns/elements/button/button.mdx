# Button

The button component is widely used and provides several variations.

## Button technical specs

* `icon` is an optional property allowing us to attach an icon as needed.
* `modifier` makes it possible to pass a CSS modifier class which in turn can change the button's appearance as you see the examples below.
* `text` is the label of the button.
* `url` is also an optional property which determines if we use a `<button>` or an `<a>` element based on the presence of the `url`.

### Default button

The default variation of the button is mostly used to perform secondary tasks such as **Cancel**, **Reset**, and others.

### Button primary

The primary button follows UCLA's branding guidelines and it's mostly use to perform important or primary tasks such as **Submit**, **Add**, **Save**, and others.

### Button secondary

Seimilar to the Primary button, the Secondary button is used for the same type of tasks where the color needs to vary for various reasons.

### Button outlined

For subtle actions or tasks, the outlined button is the one to use.

### Button with icon

If we need to add an icon to a button, we can do so by passing the icon value based on our list of icons.

### Button as a link

Sometimes we want the button to not look like a button, but rather a link. The Link button is great for adding buttons that don't stand out as much as the other buttons.
